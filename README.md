## About

This plugin gives you the ability to let users cite your work. This is required quite often in academia and journalism.

The way this is done is by appending `&do=cite` to a wiki page's URL in addition to an optional revision number, for example `rev=123456789`.

**Note:** Some templates may be "citation aware", but otherwise you will need to add code to your template's **main.php** for the citation links to appear!

## Install / Upgrade

Search and install the plugin using the [Extension Manager](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:extension). Refer to [Plugins](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins) on how to install plugins manually.

The plugin thrives from community contributions. If you're able to provide useful code changes or bug fixes, they will likely be accepted to future versions of the plugin.

Thanks!
